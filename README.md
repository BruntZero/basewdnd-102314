Our classroom activity for October 22 and 24

OH NO! My code got all frazzled (octocat walked all over the keyboard again...). I need to make changes - and fast. Take a look at article.html, located in this repository. Fork a copy of article.html and then make the corrections as needed. Some things to watch out for:

- Missing tags
- Misspelled tags
- Missing links/misspelled links/broken image links (did I forget a period? Did I forget the first part of my link?
- Nesting errors

Work alone or as a team, but be clear in your pull request who was in your group!

Part 2 (complete after our midway lesson):
- Spice up this article! Add some semantic markup tags to structure the content within. Use the following semantic markup tags:
- header
- footer
- article
- section
- time
- figure
- figcaption
